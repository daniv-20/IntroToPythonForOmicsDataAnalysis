I will try to add reference descriptions/tags when I can, but please don’t expect much organization here.\nThe references are grouped into broad categories under headings.\n\nSpatial Omics\nSpatial Data https://spatialdata.scverse.org/en/stable/ Mainly an object type to be used with different spatial omics data. It is still under development so the API may be subject to change. Uses anndata object to hold expression/fluorescence values so can be used with most scanpy-type analysis packages (scVI https://scvi-tools.org, scanpy https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/, squidpy https://squidpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\nSpaTopic https://xiyupeng.github.io/SpaTopic/ An R package for spatial topic modeling developed by Xiyu Peng. SpaTopic only requires cell type label and cell location, and can work across multiple samples. Works well with MIF data but could probably be used with other methods as well as long as cell type and location are known.\n\n\nClick for Citation\n\nPeng, X., Smithy, J.W., Yosofvand, M. et al. Scalable topic modelling decodes spatial tissue architecture for large-scale multiplexed imaging analysis.
