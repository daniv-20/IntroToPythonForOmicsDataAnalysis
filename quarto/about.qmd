The purpose of this website is to serve as a resource guide and set of notes/tutorials for 'omics analysis' in Python. This includes working with packages/programs that are geared towards omics analysis and interfacing with things like QuPath in python. 

I'm trying to make this as detailed as possible, so you should not have to know anything about programming to get started! I will link back to past tutorials and other resources during explanations of more complicated topics to keep things less wordy. 

Feel free to make use of the search function to find the information most relevant to you!
